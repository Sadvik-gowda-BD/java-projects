Always use high cohesion class.

Low cohesion: Single class responsible to do multiple operations

high cohesion: It is like single responsibility, one class should do only one operation.

The advantage of high cohesion is that such classes are much easier to maintain (and less frequently changed)
than classes with low cohesion. Another benefit of high cohesion is that classes with a well-focused purpose
tend to be more reusable than other classes.
