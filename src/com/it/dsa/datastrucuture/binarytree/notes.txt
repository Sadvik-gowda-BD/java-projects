1)To solve some kind of problems, we have to maintain some states.
-> Ex To find top view of binary tree we have to maintain some states.
    -> If we use BFS - queue<{node, horizontalDistance}> . so the first horizontalDistance is the outermost node
    ->If we use DFS -Map<Integer, {node, level}>. lowest level horizontalDistance is the outermost node

2)Use  Inorder Traversal (Left → Root → Right) for BST problems
