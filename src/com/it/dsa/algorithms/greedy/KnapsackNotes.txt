Types and How to solve them

1)Fractional Knapsack Problem
Given the weights and values of N items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack. In Fractional Knapsack, we can break items for maximizing the total value of the knapsack.
Fractional knapsack problem is solved using a greedy approach.

2)0/1 Knapsack Problem
We are given N items where each item has some weight (wi) and value (vi) associated with it. We are also given a bag with capacity W. The target is to put the items into the bag such that the sum of values associated with them is the maximum possible.
Note that here we can either put an item completely into the bag or cannot put it at all.
The 0/1 knapsack problem is solved using dynamic programming approach / recursion.

[Naive Approach] Using Recursion - A simple solution is to consider all subsets of items and calculate the total weight and value of all subsets. Consider the only subsets whose total weight is smaller than W.

3)Bounded Knapsack Problem
4)Unbounded Knapsack Problem
