Binary search

It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Time complexity of O(log n).

Binary search can be appplied on problems like:
	sorted array
	minimum and maximum range/bound

Find mid overflow case
   int mid=(low+high)/2 - can lead to overflow if low=50 and high=INTEGER_MAX, low+high value is beyond int range
   Solution
    1)use - long mid
    2)int mid = low+(high-low)/2


âœ… Use while (left <= right) when:
	You're searching for an exact value (like a classic binary search).
	You usually return immediately when you find the element (arr[mid] == target).
	You move left = mid + 1 and right = mid - 1 to shrink the window.
	Ending Condition: left > right
	If you are not sure about the expected answer & ans depend on range, then use ans variable and update ans=mid on possible side.
