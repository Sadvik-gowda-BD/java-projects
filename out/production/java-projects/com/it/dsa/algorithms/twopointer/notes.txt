It involves using two pointers to save time and space. (Here, pointers are basically array indexes).
The idea here is to iterate two different parts of the array simultaneously to get the answer faster.


There are primarily two ways of implementing the two-pointer technique:

1. One pointer at each end
    One pointer starts from beginning and other from the end, and they proceed towards each other.

2. Different Paces
    Both pointers start from the beginning but one pointer moves at a faster pace than the other one.

---------------------------------------------

1)Ex for One pointer at each end
In a sorted array, find if a pair exists with a given sum S
Reverse an array
Palindrome


2)Different Paces
Find the middle of a linked list
Is the linklist contains cycle
Find start point of the cycle
